! PharoEDA Modularization

!! Introduction

PharoEDA is already composed of different modules. The purpose of this refactoring is to split those modules into different repositories.

!!! Background

This refactoring consists of:
- Renaming classes
- Moving files across repositories.

However, PharoEDA (~develop~ branch) is evolving, and the renamed classes need to evolve as well.

!!! Objectives

- Write a tool that keeps Modularized PharoEDA in sync with PharoEDA-develop.
